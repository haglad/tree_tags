#This code is for making unique identifiers from exiting plotID, subplot number, and tree tag numbers
#This code can be used on a list of tree tag numbers which are listed numerically

#Additionally, if you have tree tag numbers that are already formatted as unique IDs,
#you can change them back into regular tag numbers for plotting from step 9

#1. add unique subplot column eventID, create as many rows for number of observations
sub <- rep(c("NNN_04_SUP"), times = 374)
plot4$sub <- sub

#2. combine plotID with Subplot 
plot4 <- unite(plot4, subPlotID, c(sub, subPlot))

colnames(plot4)
#3. write.xlsx(plot4, "C:/plot4/NNN_04_Har2017_7_formatting.xlsx")

#4. **hand edit in excel**
#the above code led to NNN_04_SUP_0_1
#I wanted NNN_04_SUP_01
#due to time constraints, i modified this in excel using the "find and replace feature"
# find: NNN_04_SUP_0_1 -> replace NNN_04_SUP_01
#then i did it for all 25 subplots. it took ~5 minutes
#I'm sure there is a better way to do this in r but i couldn't quickly find one.
#the below code is based on this mod. 


#5. add unique TT column catalogNumber, create as many rows for number of observations
TT <- rep(c("TT"), times = 374)
plot4$TT <- TT

#6. combine plotID with Subplot 
plot4 <- unite(plot4, catalogNumber, c(TT, catalogNumber))
plot4

#7. making unique string for catalogNumber with subplot ID
plot4 <- unite(plot4, catalogNumber, c(subPlotID, catalogNumber), remove = FALSE) #remove = false will keep both columns
plot4

#8 I am going to hand edit for 2-6 a zero in front of each so they read:
#NNN_04_SUP_01_TT_02
write.xlsx(plot4, "C:/plot4/NNN_04_Har2017_7_formatting.xlsx")  #remember to change to your directory 

#NAs were added by hand using Find and replace.

#9. to change the catalogNumber back to a single number ("NNN_04_SUP_01_TT_01" -> "1") for plotting and visualization
# List of numbers with common prefix

plot4 <- read.csv() #upload your data if not already

# create an empty vector where your eventual cleaned numbers will go
cleaned_numbers <- c()

# Loop through catalog numbers
for (i in 1) {
  # Create the input string from your data
  input_string <- plot4$catalogNumber   #change to your data
  
  # Remove the unique ID prefix
  cleaned_string <- gsub("NNN_04_SUP_\\d{2}_TT_", "", input_string)
  
  # Append the cleaned string to the vector
  cleaned_numbers <- c(cleaned_numbers, cleaned_string)
}

# Print the cleaned numbers
print(cleaned_numbers)

#add the tag numbers back into the code
plot4$tagno <- cleaned_numbers  #remember to change to your data
